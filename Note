if i take a look in html file which is present in the public folder in there script tag is not use for connect js How ? ans is in package.json file a react-script is present which is doing its work for connect js script .
react is a single page application because our html file has a single div or a single page.
React create a dom another than window so that we can change thing then applying on tag part of dom .
