------if i take a look in html file which is present in the public folder in there script tag is not use for connect js How ? ans is in package.json file a react-script is present which is doing its work for connect js script .
react is a single page application because our html file has a single div or a single page.
------React create a dom another than window so that we can change thing then applying on tag part of dom . 
ui apdation is control by react . we use hook for ui apdation .  
------createroot create a dom like structure behind the scene then campare it to the main dom then make changes accounding it at particular places.
in js html alway a opening tag has a closing tag. 
------onclick needed function . 
------ React has no concept of refresh the page only dom tree change so we use link tag in react rather than a tag ( a tag refresh the page ).



HOOKS :

1 - useState
2 - useCallback
3 - useEffect
4 - useRef
5 - useContext
